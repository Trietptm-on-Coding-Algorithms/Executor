TODO:

    - When removing hooks we need to verify that no threads are actually executing the hooks.
    - When we single step over a breakpoint while other threads are sleeping we need to
      verify that we wont run into a syscall since that could mean a deadlock.
    - When the software loads new libraries or unloads them we have to deal with those.
    - When hooking on ARM we do not yet save the SP register so we cannot read the original 
      stack inside the hook.
    - When we try to unload the hook library, the process crash, so we don't.
    - THUMB hooks may be wrong due to the fact that there are instructions whose size
      is 4 instead of 2. We need a C/C++ disassembler for this.

This software requires the following Ubuntu packages:

    libelf-dev
    libboost-all-dev
    
And the following library for other sources:

Kudos to skape for good documentation:
